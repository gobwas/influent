### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

  leader-lease-timeout = "500ms"

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  dir = "/tmp/influxdb/data"

  # These are the WAL settings for the storage engine >= 0.9.3
  wal-dir = "/tmp/influxdb/wal"
  wal-enable-logging = false

  # When a series in the WAL in-memory cache reaches this size in bytes it is marked as ready to
  # flush to the index
  # wal-ready-series-size = 25600

  # Flush and compact a partition once this ratio of series are over the ready size
  # wal-compaction-threshold = 0.6

  # Force a flush and compaction if any series in a partition gets above this size in bytes
  # wal-max-series-size = 2097152

  # Force a flush of all series and full compaction if there have been no writes in this
  # amount of time. This is useful for ensuring that shards that are cold for writes don't
  # keep a bunch of data cached in memory and in the WAL.
  # wal-flush-cold-interval = "10m"

  # Force a partition to flush its largest series if it reaches this approximate size in
  # bytes. Remember there are 5 partitions so you'll need at least 5x this amount of memory.
  # The more memory you have, the bigger this can be.
  # wal-partition-size-threshold = 20971520

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  shard-writer-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a shard must respond to write.
  write-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a write operation must complete on the cluster.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "10m"

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
###

[admin]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8083"
  https-enabled = false
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
###

[http]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8086"
  auth-enabled = true
  log-enabled = true
  write-tracing = false
  pprof-enabled = false
  https-enabled = false
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [[graphite]]
###
### Controls one or many listeners for Graphite data.
###

[[graphite]]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ":2003"
  # protocol = "tcp"
  # consistency-level = "one"
  # name-separator = "."

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching 
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # batch-size = 1000 # will flush if this many points get buffered
  # batch-timeout = "1s" # will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit

  ## "name-schema" configures tag names for parsing the metric name from graphite protocol;
  ## separated by `name-separator`.
  ## The "measurement" tag is special and the corresponding field will become
  ## the name of the metric.
  ## e.g. "type.host.measurement.device" will parse "server.localhost.cpu.cpu0" as
  ## {
  ##     measurement: "cpu",
  ##     tags: {
  ##         "type": "server",
  ##         "host": "localhost,
  ##         "device": "cpu0"
  ##     }
  ## }
  # name-schema = "type.host.measurement.device"

  ## If set to true, when the input metric name has more fields than `name-schema` specified,
  ## the extra fields will be ignored.
  ## Otherwise an error will be logged and the metric rejected.
  # ignore-unnamed = true

###
### [collectd]
###
### Controls the listener for collectd data.
###

[collectd]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ""
  # database = ""
  # typesdb = ""

  # These next lines control how batching works. You should have this enabled
  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching 
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # batch-size = 1000 # will flush if this many points get buffered
  # batch-timeout = "1s" # will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit

###
### [opentsdb]
###
### Controls the listener for OpenTSDB data.
###

[opentsdb]
  enabled = false
  # bind-address = ""
  # database = ""
  # retention-policy = ""

###
### [[udp]]
###
### Controls the listeners for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
###

[[udp]]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8089"
  database = "test"
  batch-size = 1000
  batch-timeout = "1ns"

###
### [monitoring]
###

[monitoring]
  enabled = true
  write-interval = "24h"

###
### [continuous_queries]
###
### Controls how continuous queries are run within InfluxDB.
###

[continuous_queries]
  log-enabled = true
  enabled = true
  recompute-previous-n = 2
  recompute-no-older-than = "10m"
  compute-runs-per-interval = 10
  compute-no-more-than = "2m"

###
### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.
###

[hinted-handoff]
  enabled = false
  dir = "/tmp/influxdb/hh"
  max-size = 1073741824
